Language translation sequence to sequence network for Udacity Deep Learning Project 4

## Sources Used

I used [this](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/decoding-layer-train-keep-prob/242022) dicussion forum to understand what the GO ID meant in the instructions.


I used [this](http://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-ii.html) web post to implement dropout.

I also used various post in the forums for help with parameters until I figured out my problem was that I sent the placeholder for my learning rate to an integer.  Ugh.
